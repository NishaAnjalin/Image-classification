# Image-classification
Image classification is a computer vision task where an algorithm analyzes an image and assigns it to one or more predefined categories (labels). It involves extracting features (such as shapes, colors, textures, or deep features from convolutional neural networks) and using them to identify what object or scene is present in the image.
